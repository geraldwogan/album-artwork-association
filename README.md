## Git Initiliazation
https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e

1. Create directory on local
1. Create identical repo on remote (GitHub)
1. Follow these commands

```
$ git init
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/geraldwogan/allmusic-artist-association.git
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
```

## Virtual Env init
$ python -m venv venv
$ echo /venv/ >> .gitignore
$ venv\scripts\activate
(venv) $ pip install ...
(venv) $ deactivate
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt (Run this each time you install a new package)

## Using APIs in Python
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/



## Brief outline
1. Download media tracking file as xlsx and convert to .csv
1. Extract relevant content (master id from ID column of rows labeled 'Album')
1. Get info (Genre, Release Year, Album Cover) from API using master id.
    - Use this guide for authentication: https://github.com/jesseward/discogs-oauth-example
    - Create discogs.com account.
    - pip install oauth2 library
1. Add album data to excel file as a seperate sheet.

OAuth in a nutshell
Obtain consumer keys : The application developer registers their new application at https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers . Discogs assigns a consumer_key and consumer_secret for the application. This is a one-time action required on behalf of the developer and their application. Each application is assigned a unique value.

Request a token : The application sends the consumer_key and consumer_secret to the request_token endpoint (http://api.discogs.com/oauth/request_token). Discogs returns a request_token and secret

Request user access : Request the user to grant access to your application. This is done by directing the user to a URL. The URL is generated by your application, it simply appends the request_token and secret returned in step 2 to http://www.discogs.com/oauth/authorize. If the user accepts this request, discogs will return a verification code. Store this verification code for the next request (step 4).

Request token verification : The application sends the request_token and request token secret along withe the verification code to the Discogs api. If the API validates your request, you're returned an access_token and an access token secret. You must store or persist this access_token for the user.

Fetching data via your access_token: You're now able to fetch data using the OAuth process. For all authenticated requests, you pass the access_token and access_token secret.
